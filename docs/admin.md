# ยง10. Use of Admin Commands

## 10.1 Scope  
This section governs the use of administrative powers granted via **Adonis**. It applies to all individuals ranked **Officer+** or otherwise granted admin access.

## 10.2 Authorized Use  
Administrative commands shall only be used to:  
- Enforce group rules and remove disruptive players  
- Moderate during official events (e.g., trainings, patrols, raids)  
- Assist in legitimate investigations (e.g., spectating for evidence)  
- Reset broken players or fix game issues

## 10.3 Prohibited Use  
The following uses are strictly prohibited and may constitute **Admin Abuse (Tier II)**:  
- Using **:fly**, **:speed**, **:noclip**, or similar to gain advantage during events  
- Teleporting to players or locations for personal convenience  
- Using **:kick**, **:ban**, or **:crash** without proper justification  
- Spawning items, tools, or transports not related to official activities  
- Issuing punitive commands (e.g., **:jail**, **:blind**) as a joke or without authority  
- Modifying your own rank, admin level, or immunity
- Also, **NEVER** use **:m**, there is essentially no use for it. Use **:h** for minor messages and **:n** for server-wide announcements. **:m** is HiCOM+.
- Usage of **:tempmod** or other commands by anyone other than HQ is __strictly__ prohibited. Permissions are set by HQ and bypassing these permissions is absolutely not allowed for any reason, especially during official events.

## 10.4 Event-Specific Permissions  
During official events, trainers or event hosts may use limited commands to assist operation. Namely: 
- **:tp**, **:bring**, or **:respawn / :re** 
- **:n**, **:pm**, or **:announce**  
- Temporary usage of **:speed** or **:fly** must be approved by HiCOM+ and used minimally.

## 10.5 Logs and Oversight  
All admin usage is automatically logged by Adonis. The **JAGC and PC** reserve the right to audit logs at any time. Abuse may be punished retroactively.

## 10.6 Emergency Use  
In emergencies (e.g., exploiters, server crash threats), all admins may take immediate action, but must:  
1. Document the incident  
2. Report to a superior or HQ within 1 hour  
3. Justify any use of extreme powers (e.g., bans or server lock)

## 10.7 Suspension of Admin  
Admin privileges may be temporarily suspended during active investigations or as part of disciplinary action. Refusal to comply will escalate the offense.
