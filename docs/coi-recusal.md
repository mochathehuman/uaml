## 9.2 Definition of Conflict of Interest  
A conflict of interest exists when an individual:  
- Has a **personal, familial, or close relationship** with the accused or reporting party.  
- Was directly involved in the **incident under review**.  
- Stands to **gain or lose** based on the case outcome.  
- Has demonstrated **prior bias** or expressed public opinion on the case.  
- Is **currently under investigation** by the same reporting party or entity.

- **Command Staff involved in punishment or appeals**

## 9.4 Discretionary Recusal  
If a conflict is unclear or disputed, the matter should be escalated to the **JAGC Command** for final determination. Voluntary recusal is encouraged when impartiality may be reasonably questioned.
