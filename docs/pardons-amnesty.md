# §8. Pardon and Amnesty Policy

## 8.1 Authority to Grant Pardon or Amnesty  
The power to issue a **Pardon** or **Amnesty** resides solely with the **Commander-in-Chief**, or an individual explicitly delegated such authority in writing. These actions are considered extraordinary and are not a standard part of the judicial process.

## 8.2 Definitions  
- **Pardon**: The full or partial forgiveness of an individual’s punishment while leaving the conviction intact.  
- **Amnesty**: A blanket forgiveness applied to a class of offenses or individuals, typically to promote reconciliation or reform.  

## 8.3 Eligibility  
Individuals may be considered for a pardon if:  
- A significant portion of their punishment has been served in good faith.  
- New evidence or mitigating circumstances arise post-conviction.  
- The offense was minor or non-malicious in nature.  
- There has been no repeat violation since sentencing.

Amnesty may be issued to cover:  
- Widespread minor infractions from a specific time period.  
- Offenses resulting from outdated or repealed policies.  
- Participants of a disputed or irregular disciplinary action.

## 8.4 Request Procedure  
1. The individual or their superior may submit a **Pardon Request Form** to the JAGC.  
2. The JAGC will review the request and forward a recommendation to the Commander-in-Chief.  
3. Final judgment rests with the Commander-in-Chief or their designee.

## 8.5 Effect of Pardon or Amnesty  
- The individual’s **disciplinary record shall reflect the pardon/amnesty**, with the offense still visible but marked as forgiven.  
- Any remaining punishment is immediately lifted.  
- The pardon does not imply innocence unless explicitly stated.

## 8.6 Limitations  
- A pardon does not automatically restore lost promotions or medals unless specified.  
- Pardons may not be issued for **Tier III offenses** without unanimous HiCOM approval.  
- No self-pardons are permitted.

## 8.7 Revocation  
A pardon may be revoked if it is later found to have been granted under false pretenses or if the individual reoffends within 30 days of the pardon.
