Appendix: Admin Abuse Interpretation Issued: May 22, 2025 Definition Clarification (\u00a72.2) Admin Abuse does not include: - Unintentional , non-malicious misuse - Self-reported incidents - No material harm caused Examples: - Misclick teleports - Duplicate messages - Admin tool misuse in harmless training Repeated/unreported misuse is not exempt. Must be applied in all future cases unless overridden. \u00a77.A-2. Appendix: JAGC Role and Jurisdiction Effective immediately: All crimes involving Commissioned Officers (Lieutenant and above) are under the jurisdiction of the Judge Advocate General's Corps (JAGC) . This includes Tier 2 and Tier 3 offenses committed by Lieutenants, Captains, High Command, or higher ranks. These cases must be handled directly by, or in coordination with, JAGC personnel. Regimental officers or standard Provost Corps members are not authorized to unilaterally prosecute or resolve such matters. Rationale: Commissioned Officers hold elevated authority, including the power to enforce laws and govern regimental conduct. Oversight of these officers must be conducted by the group\u2019s military legal authority to ensure fairness, uniform standards, and legal integrity. Clarification: If there is uncertainty about jurisdiction, the case must be elevated to JAGC or HQ. This clarification is issued to preserve the impartial enforcement of Military Law and the integrity of our command structure. \u00a77.A-2.a. SUBAPPENDIX A In response to concerns regarding the recent policy clarification assigning Commissioned+ crimes to JAGC oversight, let us be unequivocally clear: The role of the Provost Corps remains fully intact and operational within its defined jurisdiction. This announcement does not remove or diminish the PC's authority in any way\u2014it simply ensures proper legal oversight over higher-ranking personnel. Specifically: Provost Corps continue to handle all Tier I and Tier II offenses involving Enlisted and Non-Commissioned personnel. PCs are expected to respond to any violations they personally witness , regardless of the offender\u2019s rank\u2014 but if the offender is Commissioned or higher , the case must then be elevated to JAGC. The JAGC clarification applies to who must lead or finalize action on crimes involving Lieutenants and above \u2014not who can report, detain, or intervene during an incident. Why this distinction exists: Commissioned personnel possess disciplinary authority and command responsibilities. Any allegations against them require independent review to avoid conflicts of interest and ensure legal integrity. In short: The JAGC handles who is judged when the accused holds command powers. The PC still handles what happens when any crime is witnessed in the field, especially among those of lower rank. This is not a replacement. It is a reinforcement of procedural fairness and structural clarity. \u00a77.A-2.b. SUBAPPENDIX B Clarification: Tier III crimes should also be reported to JAGC. However, these cases will only be investigated by JAGC. JAGC will investigate and determine if a crime was actually committed and provide a recommendation for punishment to HQ if it is deemed to be a crime.

Amnesty : A blanket forgiveness applied to a class of offenses or individuals, typically to promote reconciliation or reform. 8.3 Eligibility Individuals may be considered for a pardon if: - A significant portion of their punishment has been served in good faith. - New evidence or mitigating circumstances arise post-conviction. - The offense was minor or non-malicious in nature. - There has been no repeat violation since sentencing. Amnesty may be issued to cover: - Widespread minor infractions from a specific time period. - Offenses resulting from outdated or repealed policies. - Participants of a disputed or irregular disciplinary action. 8.4 Request Procedure The individual or their superior may submit a Pardon Request Form to the JAGC.

Pardons may not be issued for Tier III offenses without unanimous HiCOM approval.
